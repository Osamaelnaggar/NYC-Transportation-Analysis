# Metropolitan City Traffic Analysis - Capstone Project

This project is the final capstone for the German University in Cairo's Data Engineering & AI Diploma. It provides a comprehensive end-to-end data pipeline for analyzing urban traffic patterns using real New York City traffic datasets.

## 🚦 Project Overview

We analyze traffic trends in a large metropolitan city using public NYC Taxi datasets (Bus, Subway, Taxi). The pipeline performs:

- Ingestion of large-scale raw data
- Preprocessing & cleaning
- Data warehousing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning for ride duration prediction
- Dashboarding using Apache Superset

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project leverages a modern data engineering stack:

- **Apache Airflow** – DAG orchestration
- **PostgreSQL** – Data warehouse
- **Docker** – Containerized deployment
- **Pandas, Scikit-learn** – Data processing & ML
- **Apache Superset** – Visualization & BI
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – EDA & experimentation

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure Docker is installed
3. From Docker folder Run (add build as bash parameter to rebuild containers):

<pre> ```bash # Initialize Postgress and Airflow services bash init.sh build # Initialize Superset bash init_superset.sh ``` </pre>

4. Access Airflow at: `http://localhost:8080`
5. Access Superset at: `http://localhost:8088`

## 🧠 Machine Learning

We trained models on Taxi data to predict trip fare using:
- Deep Learning FFNN Model

## 📊 Dashboards

Notebooks code provide key insights to be used on superset dashboard:
- Trip durations over time
- Day vs. night ride trends
